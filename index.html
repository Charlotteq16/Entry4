<div class="thoughts-container">
    <p class="thoughts"> found this quote drawn on the floor of Washington Square park, but this quote is actually orignally said by the fictional character, the Joker. The original context of this quote is about the Jokers father and how he went crazy and slashed his sons face while saying "why so serious, lets put a smile on that face" However, if I didn't have any prior knowledge, I feel like the mood switches instantly from disturbing to sweet and uplifting. Like its telling me to just be happy and not take life so seriously. To have fun in life while im still here and able. Its a reminder, that most of my problems are not that serious as I make them out to be. As a very anxious person, I tend to overthink so many things that really... are not that serious :D So while the Jokers words are meant to be quite unsettling, seeing this quote in one of my favorites parks in such pretty, innocent like handwriting, I see it in a different light. A not so serious light ;D</p>
